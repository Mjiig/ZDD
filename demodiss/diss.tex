\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

To build an implementation of Zero Suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs), and a solver for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) that makes use of them to represent possible solutions. The performance of this solver was then compared to that of a standard dynamic programming solution to the same problem, with the intention to show that both had the same asymptotic complexity. 


\section*{Work Completed}

An python package implementing ZDDs, as well as a number of standard logical operators on them has been implemented and tested. A TSP solver built on this package has been built, along with a solver using a dynamic programming algorithm and a brute force solver (for correctness verification). In order to measure the performance of these solvers, a framework for generating random instance of TSP has been built, and the performance of all of the solvers on these instances has been measured.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

A mistaken assumption about how operations that can be used to encode negation behave on ZDDs (due to a substantial difference to the behaviour of traditional BDDs), led to a significant delay in completing the correct implementation of the implication and negation operators, which are essential for this project.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Binary Decision Diagrams}
The general principle of a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) is to give a canonical graph based representation of boolean functions (or equivalently, sentences of propositional logic). The most trivial way to achieve this is with a binary decision tree, in which we take a rooted tree, every internal node of which has two children and is labelled with one of the inputs to the function being represented. Every node on the same layer of the tree should be labelled with the same input, and a path from root to leaf should contain exactly one node labelled with each variable.

If we label the arcs from each node to it's children $T$ and $F$, and say that following an arc labelled $T$ from a node labelled $p$ corresponds to assuming that $p$ is true, and vice versa for $F$, we now have a tree in which every possible assignment of inputs to the function being represented corresponds to a unique path from root to leaf of the tree. We can represent the value of the function given these inputs by labelling the leaf node $1$ or $0$ for true and false respectively.

\section{Verbatim text}

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small
\begin{verbatim}
GET "libhdr"
 
GLOBAL { count:200; all  }
 
LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }
LET start() = VALOF
{ all := 1
  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)
    all := 2*all + 1
  }
  RESULTIS 0
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Tables}

\begin{samepage}
Here is a simple example\footnote{A footnote} of a table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
Left      & Centred & Right \\
Justified &         & Justified \\[3mm]
%\hline\\%[-2mm]
First     & A       & XXX \\
Second    & AA      & XX  \\
Last      & AAA     & X   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
There is another example table in the proforma.

\section{Simple diagrams}

Simple diagrams can be written directly in \LaTeX.  For example, see
figure~\ref{latexpic1} on page~\pageref{latexpic1} and see
figure~\ref{latexpic2} on page~\pageref{latexpic2}.

\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript (EPS) or PDF to represent complicated graphics.
Figure~\ref{epsfig} and~\ref{xfig} on page \pageref{xfig} are
examples. The second figure was drawn using \texttt{xfig} and exported in
{\tt.eps} format. This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.


\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centerline{\includegraphics{figs/cuarms.pdf}}
\caption{Example figure using encapsulated postscript}
\label{epsfig}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\vspace{4in}
\caption{Example figure where a picture can be pasted in}
\label{pastedfig}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[tbh]

\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Printing and binding}

Use a ``duplex'' laser printer that can print on both sides to print
two copies of your dissertation. Then bind them, for example using the
comb binder in the Computer Laboratory Library.

\chapter{Conclusion}

I hope that this rough guide to writing a dissertation is \LaTeX\ has
been helpful and saved you time.
